                        <p><b>The Turbans</b> are a travelling gypsy kelzmer balkan band, their hometown is
                        manywhere. They are an international musical collective bringing together
                        exciting music from traditional near-eastern and eastern-European styles and
                        their own compositions, to create a modern and energetic performance with
                        reverence for its ancient roots.</p>

                        <p>Growing from very humble beginnings, in just a few years it turned into a
                        progressive name on the London music scene. It's members have gathered from
                        countries such as <b>Turkey, Bulgaria, Israel, Italy, Greece and England to
                            perform in the UK, Turkey, India</b> and all over Europe.</p>

                        <p>The Turbans is independent and run by the musicians themselves, bringing music
                        to the public, young and old alike, mixing vibrant spontaneity and authenticity
                        with multi-genre instrumental and vocal excellence.</p>

                        <p>Lisa Angel started her love affair with the Hula Hoop at age 25 in a small town
                        in the South of England. In the late winter of 2010, she took a 6 month trip to
                        India . She found a world of circus artists, fire dancers and beautiful
                        Parisian jugglers that made her think there was another way to get through
                        life... a way to express all the intense emotions and creative bursts that
                        continuously flowed through her mind, body and soul. She discovered a life as a
                        performing artist. Since that winter of 2010 she has been traveling all over
                        the world following the artist's path, teaching herself as she goes, diving
                        into the worlds of dance and circus. Trying to make enough money to move from
                        place to place, to keep learning, training and creating with her best friends:
                        her hula hoops. </p>
