                       Take a moment. Close your eyes and imagine a ginormous
                       crowd, thronging around the stage, the place jam-packed,
                       thousands of voices shouting, almost fanatical, just one
                       name. The atmosphere is electric and the music sublime,
                       and hordes of maniacal fans enjoying like they have
                       never done. This is Encore. 
                       </p>
                       <p>Over the last couple of
                       years, Encore has seen breath-taking and scintillating
                       performances by the likes of <b>Sunidhi Chauhan, KK, Javed
                           Ali, Kunal Ganjawala, Indian Ocean, Raghu Dixit Project</b>
                       and many more. And this year we want more. We present
                       the duo who created memorable numbers for movies such as
                       Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, Chak De! India, Fashion, Heroine,
                       Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl and Band Baaja Baaraat among many

                        </p>
                        <p>Feel the air shiver and let your mind loose. Come to
                        the western night to enjoy the pure distilled essence
                        of music, the melody of the instruments and the
                        complexity of creation. This stage has witnessed
                        astounding music from the likes of <b>Led Zepplica,
                        Breathe the Floyd, Jailbreak, Eccentric Pendulum and
                        MoherJane </b>. This year we bring two other great bands
                        that put their music before anything else.  </p>
                        <p> <b>The F16s</b>
                        play alternative dance music borne out of frustration
                        with a barren and flaccid cityscape. The band has an EP
                        out, named 'Kaleidoscope'. Consisting of seven songs,
                        the record acts as an effective acid test, laying the
                        groundwork for an arresting live set.
