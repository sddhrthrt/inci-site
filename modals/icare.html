                    There is a broad agreement that violence in all its forms
                has gone up in both general and specific terms. Of late, crimes against women
                are showing an upward trend, in India in general. The gruesome case of Nirbhaya
                had paved way for many reformative amendments to existing laws and yet, the
                onslaught goes on.<br/> 

                Are legal reforms solely capable of changing the
                scenario? Can it set right the gender balance? What can we as the civil society
                do to root out this social evil?<br/> 

                Decades of struggle and numerous
                international conventions and constitutional provisions, the answers are not
                clear, despite pro-active legislation.<br/> 

                One basic cause for this could be
                attributed to the lack of legal awareness as well as its social perspective,
                and the intricacies involved in the ameliorating the situation.<br/> 

                Sensing the need of the hour, Incident iCare 2014, in
                association with NITK-IEEE student chapter, take pride in hosting a talk and
                panel discussion on Crime against Women: An Indian Perspective, to be graced by
                dignitaries from the
                society.<br/> 

                During the programme, the dignitaries would also be releasing
                NITK-IEEE's The Jagrit Bachpan Project, an in-house developed mobile and web
                application platform aimed at streamlining and fast-tracking child abuse
                reporting, based on the philosophy that the easier it is to do something and
                make a change for the better, the more the chances that one would indeed try.

                    Given that all of us have heard of ways to be more socially conscious or nature
                    friendly, why is that no one follows them? What are the reasons for the
                    existing gap between people intentions and their actual behavior when it comes
                    to environmental issues? A lot of NGOs work with this objective of creating an
                    environment friendly world. But they donâ€™t seem to motivate the people enough
                    to change their way of living. So how could we bring about a change in attitude
                    of the socially unconcerned people? Can marketing tools be of any use in
                    erasing this gap and motivating consumers to convert their intentions into
                    actions?

                    Today NGOs are facing one major problem. Though they have a large number of
                    volunteers who wish to work, but there are only very few people who actively
                    participate and are ready to take an initiative. Their lethargy/busy schedule
                    takes over the interest in giving their contribution to the society. Thus the
                    NGOs find difficulties in keeping them positively engaged/motivated for the
                    entire period of time. Come up with a detailed plan to overcome this issue.

                    We know how a Company (for-profit organization) is performing in the market by
                    observing the profits and losses made by the company. But what about the NGOs?
                    Quantifying performance and measuring results are no longer the sole domain of
                    for-profit enterprises. Today, many NGOs find themselves unable to answer the
                    donors who expect to see proper accounts to show how their money was spent and
                    what that spending achieved. And quantifying the performance also plays a
                    crucial role in publicizing/expanding the NGO. Yet there has been a great
                    difficulty to establish a set of hard-and-fast metrics to measure social
                    performance. How should this issue be handled?

                    Everyday we read about rape cases in the newspapers. Some are blown up, known
                    to everyone, and some just die the silent death. So even after so many protests
                    and so many laws in place, still women safety is a big issue? Any women to
                    travel alone at night fears. Eve-teasing happens in broad daylight. So what do
                    you think can be done to increase protection for women? What can be done so
                    that women will be confident to wander out without fear?
