                    There is a broad agreement that violence in all its forms
                has gone up in both general and specific terms. Of late, crimes against women
                are showing an upward trend, in India in general. The gruesome case of Nirbhaya
                had paved way for many reformative amendments to existing laws and yet, the
                onslaught goes on.<br/> 

                Are legal reforms solely capable of changing the
                scenario? Can it set right the gender balance? What can we as the civil society
                do to root out this social evil?<br/> 

                Decades of struggle and numerous
                international conventions and constitutional provisions, the answers are not
                clear, despite pro-active legislation.<br/> 

                One basic cause for this could be
                attributed to the lack of legal awareness as well as its social perspective,
                and the intricacies involved in the ameliorating the situation.<br/> 

                Sensing the need of the hour, Incident iCare 2014, in
                association with NITK-IEEE student chapter, take pride in hosting a talk and
                panel discussion on Crime against Women: An Indian Perspective, to be graced by
                dignitaries from the
                society.<br/> 

                During the programme, the dignitaries would also be releasing
                NITK-IEEE's The Jagrit Bachpan Project, an in-house developed mobile and web
                application platform aimed at streamlining and fast-tracking child abuse
                reporting, based on the philosophy that the easier it is to do something and
                make a change for the better, the more the chances that one would indeed try.
