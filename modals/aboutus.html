                National Institute of Technology Surathkal, Karnataka, was founded in 1960 on
                the pristine sands of the west coast of India. With its own private beach,
                which includes a lighthouse, NITK lies just an hour north of Mangalore, on the
                NH 66. Its expansive campus houses over five thousand students from all across
                the country, making this an extremely diverse place. NITK has consistently been
                voted among the best engineering colleges in India. Apart from the usual
                academic excellence, the students of NITK organize themselves into many
                technical and non-technical clubs and conduct various events throughout the
                year. But, the biggest annual events here would be Engineer, our technical
                symposium, and Incident, our cultural festival, both of which are completely
                overseen by the students of the college from the feet up.
                </p><p>
                Incident, the annual cultural fest of NITK, was started way back in the 80's
                and has grown bigger ever since. This year, we are reminiscing about those good
                old retro days, and we invite everyone to come and enjoy the celebration with
                us. Incident has become a permanent event on the calendar of every college
                student in the state. It has been bringing together great artists and
                performers, such as Led Zeppelica, MotherJane, Breathe The Floyd, Sunidhi
                Chauhan and countless others; and it has seen some truly memorable and
                magnificent performances. With an inexhaustible array of exciting events, a
                beach where you can kick back and relax and an invigorating and thrilling
                basketball competition, Slam Dunk, we aim to keep you engaged and entertained.
                And with the huge number of prizes which are there to be won, nothing should be
                holding you back from getting on a train and racing over to our sands.
                </p>
